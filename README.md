# Eric Brant‚Äôs Web Dev Portfolio

Greetings, my name is Eric Brant. I‚Äôm exploring the world of programming, and I‚Äôm hoping to find a new land to settle. Before I began exploring the shores of programming, I was exploring the worlds of literature and linguistics. Now I get to explore computer linguistics while learning coding. I hope to be a polyglot in computer languages soon so I can properly communicate with the residents in these new territories. Eventually I want to design video games, including text-based adventure games, with strong stories that will inspire rich imaginations.
